# first-binder-explore

This repo is taking a look at using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to share research

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mawds/first-binder-explore/HEAD)


## Direct links

[Jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mawds/first-binder-explore/68bb1dd795a199d7c87851425867f541436a3343?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fjupyter%2Fjupyter.ipynb)

[Pluto notebook](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.4/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fmawds%252Ffirst-binder-explore%252Fdeps%252Fjulia%252Fpomdps.jl) (this is one of the tutorial notebooks from https://juliaacademy.com/courses/decision-making-under-uncertainty-with-pomdps-jl/lectures/34881808 to give something with more credible depenencies than "hello world")


### Notes

You can't (as far as I can tell) run a Julia Pluto notebook in the regular mybinder Binder.  Instead, go to https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/ and paste a link to the raw version of the Pluto notebook, i.e. navigate to the notebook in Github, and copy the link behind this button:
